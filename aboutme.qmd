## Background

### Education
I completed my Bachelors in Wildlife Sciences at Mississippi State University in May of 2023. I entered the ILS program at UGA the following August and have since matriculated into the EHS program as a first year in Erin Lipp's lab.

### Hometown
I was born in Orange, CA and raised in Collierville, TN outside of Memphis. My parents and 5 pets (3 cats and 2 dogs) still live there!

### Fun Fact
During field research on pollinators at my undergraduate university, I was stung about 5 times by a swarm of yellowjackets that I apparently offended! I couldn't move one of my fingers for three days.

## Research Interests/Experience

### Current Research
I don't have my own project yet, but I'm interested in pursuing research on bacterial pathogens and environmental epidemiology. I would love to include a wildlife aspect!

### Experience
I have taken some basic statistics courses and an overview of data analysis using R. I don't know any coding languages, but I can navigate RStudio and make some basic plots and analyses.

### Hopes for the class
I hope to become proficient in making my data usable for analysis and to learn more about creating a workflow that allows for reproducibility.

### Interesting Data Analysis Facts
[**This website**](https://codinghero.ai/interesting-facts-about-data-science/) has some fun facts about data analysis. I found it interesting that 80% of a data scientist's time is spent cleaning the data!
