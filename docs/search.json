Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nWarning: package 'here' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\n\nhere() starts at D:/MADA/kevinkosewick-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

We’ll create two plots; one that analyzes life expectancy vs infant mortality and one that analyzes life expectancy vs population size. The latter will have a log scale to make the data easier to visualize.\n\n#load ggplot2 to create better plots\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Plot 1: Life expectancy vs. Infant mortality. lab() creates titles for the graph.\nggplot(african_countries_infant_life, aes(x = infant_mortality, y = life_expectancy)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Life Expectancy vs. Infant Mortality\")\n\nWarning: Removed 226 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 2: Life expectancy vs. Population size.\n#scale_x_log10 puts the x axis (population) on a log scale.\nggplot(african_countries_pop_life, aes(x = population, y = life_expectancy)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_log10() +\n  labs(title = \"Life Expectancy vs. Population Size (log scale)\")\n\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Plot 1, we can see a negative correlation. As life expectancy decreases, the number of infants dying increases; this makes sense since more developed countries with better healthcare have higher life expectancies and lower infant mortality rates. In Plot 2, population size and life expectancy are positively correlated. This is logical, as longer lives allow for greater population growth and more infrequent deaths. The “streaks” in the data can be attributed to the presence of different years for individual countries in the dataset.\nKnowing this, we can begin to narrow in on certain years and see which ones would be easiest to analyze given our dataset. We’ll figure out which years have missing data for infant mortality.\n\n#find which years have missing data for infant mortality. \n#is.na() identifies which rows have na as their value\n#select() shows us the years that are associated with these rows.\nafrican_countries %&gt;%\n  filter(is.na(infant_mortality)) %&gt;%\n  select(year)\n\n    year\n1   1960\n2   1960\n3   1960\n4   1960\n5   1960\n6   1960\n7   1960\n8   1960\n9   1960\n10  1960\n11  1961\n12  1961\n13  1961\n14  1961\n15  1961\n16  1961\n17  1961\n18  1961\n19  1961\n20  1961\n21  1961\n22  1961\n23  1961\n24  1961\n25  1961\n26  1961\n27  1961\n28  1962\n29  1962\n30  1962\n31  1962\n32  1962\n33  1962\n34  1962\n35  1962\n36  1962\n37  1962\n38  1962\n39  1962\n40  1962\n41  1962\n42  1962\n43  1962\n44  1963\n45  1963\n46  1963\n47  1963\n48  1963\n49  1963\n50  1963\n51  1963\n52  1963\n53  1963\n54  1963\n55  1963\n56  1963\n57  1963\n58  1963\n59  1963\n60  1964\n61  1964\n62  1964\n63  1964\n64  1964\n65  1964\n66  1964\n67  1964\n68  1964\n69  1964\n70  1964\n71  1964\n72  1964\n73  1964\n74  1964\n75  1965\n76  1965\n77  1965\n78  1965\n79  1965\n80  1965\n81  1965\n82  1965\n83  1965\n84  1965\n85  1965\n86  1965\n87  1965\n88  1965\n89  1966\n90  1966\n91  1966\n92  1966\n93  1966\n94  1966\n95  1966\n96  1966\n97  1966\n98  1966\n99  1966\n100 1966\n101 1966\n102 1967\n103 1967\n104 1967\n105 1967\n106 1967\n107 1967\n108 1967\n109 1967\n110 1967\n111 1967\n112 1967\n113 1968\n114 1968\n115 1968\n116 1968\n117 1968\n118 1968\n119 1968\n120 1968\n121 1968\n122 1968\n123 1968\n124 1969\n125 1969\n126 1969\n127 1969\n128 1969\n129 1969\n130 1969\n131 1970\n132 1970\n133 1970\n134 1970\n135 1970\n136 1971\n137 1971\n138 1971\n139 1971\n140 1971\n141 1971\n142 1972\n143 1972\n144 1972\n145 1972\n146 1972\n147 1972\n148 1973\n149 1973\n150 1973\n151 1973\n152 1973\n153 1973\n154 1974\n155 1974\n156 1974\n157 1974\n158 1974\n159 1975\n160 1975\n161 1975\n162 1975\n163 1975\n164 1976\n165 1976\n166 1976\n167 1977\n168 1977\n169 1977\n170 1978\n171 1978\n172 1979\n173 1979\n174 1980\n175 1981\n176 2016\n177 2016\n178 2016\n179 2016\n180 2016\n181 2016\n182 2016\n183 2016\n184 2016\n185 2016\n186 2016\n187 2016\n188 2016\n189 2016\n190 2016\n191 2016\n192 2016\n193 2016\n194 2016\n195 2016\n196 2016\n197 2016\n198 2016\n199 2016\n200 2016\n201 2016\n202 2016\n203 2016\n204 2016\n205 2016\n206 2016\n207 2016\n208 2016\n209 2016\n210 2016\n211 2016\n212 2016\n213 2016\n214 2016\n215 2016\n216 2016\n217 2016\n218 2016\n219 2016\n220 2016\n221 2016\n222 2016\n223 2016\n224 2016\n225 2016\n226 2016\n\n\nThere is data missing up to 1981 and then again for 2016, so we’ll select 2000.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing informatio"

As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nWarning: package 'here' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\n\nhere() starts at D:/MADA/kevinkosewick-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.
